        <h1>Button Game Platform</h1>
        <p class="project-detail-desc">An interactive game platform built with wood and PLA to play a variety of games.<br><br>
            <b>Technologies used:</b> Microcontroller Programming, Circuits, 3D printing, Computer-Aided Design, Woodworking.<br><br>
            <b>About the project:</b> An interactive game built with wood and PLA and programmed into an arduino uno. 
            Designed to test player reaction time and advertise the Gizmologists to students on grounds during outreach events.</i>

            <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Design and Build</b> The button game platform was designed using Fusion 360 for the 3D printed components and hand-drawn 
                plans for the wooden frame. The wooden frame was constructed using plywood and 2x4's, while the button casing and internal components were 3D printed using PLA. 
                The design focused on durability and ease of assembly, ensuring that the platform could withstand frequent use during outreach events.</p>

            <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Frame Construction</b> The wooden frame was constructed using plywood and 2x4's, 
                with joints carefully designed to ensure structural integrity and ease of assembly. We used a miter saw, jointer, 
                and planer to build the frame to hold the buttons. The frame provides a stable base for the 3D printed button casing 
                and internal components, allowing for a secure and durable platform suitable for repeated use during outreach events.</p>

            <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>3D Printed Components</b> Designed 3D printed topper to be overlayed on the wooden frame. 
                Includes sockets for inserting buttons and mount for OLED display. This topper was 3D printed in three sections and fitted 
                together on top of a plywood layer.</p>

            <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Circuitry</b> Used 2n3904 npn transistors to sink sufficient power through the LEDs inbuilt into 
                the buttons and programmed a variety of games into the arduino, such as whack-a-mole, reaction duel, and a memory game.</p>

            <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Perfboard</b> Designed and soldered perfboard to neatly organize components and 
                facilitate connections between the buttons, OLED display, and Arduino Uno. This approach ensured a clean and reliable 
                wiring setup, minimizing potential issues during operation and making future modifications or repairs easier.</p>
