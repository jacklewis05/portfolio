        <h1>Clean My Water</h1>
        <p class="project-detail-desc">A portable, natural-material-based water filtration system for Outdoor Enthusiasts.<br><br>
            <b>Technologies used:</b> Materials science, filtration design, manufacturing, practical engineering.<br><br>
            <b>Summary:</b> The Clean My Water project addresses the need for portable, natural-material-based 
            water filtration solutions for outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, and campers. Tasked with creating a low-cost, 
            sustainable filter capable of producing safe drinking water from natural sources, our team developed, tested, 
            and iterated on a gravity-fed filtration design using pine wood, pumice, and charcoal. </i>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">Our methodology began with client interviews and a literature review to define design constraints emphasizing pathogen removal, 
                portability, affordability, and natural material usage. Several filtration concepts were proposed, including reed-based and 
                sediment-based designs. However, analysis of performance and practicality led us to select a pine-xylem-based osmosis design, 
                supplemented by pumice and charcoal layers to enhance filtration efficiency and reduce clogging. </p>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">Testing evaluated key performance metrics: water turbidity, E. coli presence, flow rate, durability, 
                and usability. Results demonstrated an 81.9% reduction in turbidity and a 97.4% reduction in E. coli levels, achieving compliance 
                with EPA drinking water standards. User feedback rated usability at 90%, meeting portability and ease-of-use targets. 
                Early flow rate assessments revealed slower-than-desired output, prompting design revisions that improved sealing and pressure application, 
                with further optimization recommended. </p>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">In conclusion, our final prototype was successful in fulfilling most of the project objectives, 
                providing a low-cost, effective, and sustainable personal water filtration device. Future work should be conducted, 
                focusing on increasing the flow rate and lifespan of the filter.  We should also explore further research applications 
                for this technology in areas that do not currently have access to clean drinking water or the resources to construct municipal 
                water treatment plants .</p>

            <h2 class="project-detail-h2">Initial Design Considerations</h2>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">The initial design phase involved brainstorming various filtration methods and materials. 
                We considered factors such as the natural availability of materials, ease of assembly, and effectiveness in removing contaminants. 
                The chosen design incorporated layers of pine wood for its natural filtration properties, pumice for mechanical filtration, 
                and charcoal for chemical adsorption.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">We chose to develop the pine-based osmosis filter, as it proved to be the most reliable design compared to the alternatives.
                 We had concerns about the effectiveness of the other options. The reed-based design carried the risk of water bypassing the membrane, 
                 while research on sediment-based filtration indicated it would not meet our project’s criteria for effective water purification. 
                 These concerns were reinforced by our peer reviewers. </p>

            <h2 class="project-detail-h2">Final Design and Testing</h2>
            <figure class="project-figure">

            </figure>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">This filtration system combines charcoal, crushed pumice, and a cross-cut piece of pine sapwood to remove 
                sediments and bacteria from water. The charcoal layer helps eliminate unpleasant tastes and certain chemicals, while the pumice traps 
                organic matter like algae and prevents oils from passing through. The pine component consists of a freshly cut wood disk, allowing water 
                to flow through xylem cell membranes, effectively removing most bacteria and pathogens. Layers of natural sponge separate the filtration 
                materials, ensuring efficiency.</p>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">The system is housed in a PVC pipe, with a flexible PVC adapter securing the pine wood at the end of the filter 
                for easy replacement. Additionally, 3D-printed adapters connect the filter to a five-foot vinyl tube, which is attached to a two-liter bag or soda bottle. 
                This setup provides approximately 2 psi of pressure for filtration. </p>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">Each pine filter is expected to last about a week, provided it remains wet. The design requires minimal maintenance, 
                with the only necessary replacement being the pine filter, which can be easily swapped by loosening the hose clamp.  </p>
            <h3 class="project-detail-h3">E.coli Testing</h3>
            <!-- <p class ="project-detail-desc">
            <b >Retention Test:</b> The filter housing, without filtration media, will be filled with water to check for leaks. This ensures that dirty water does not contaminate the filtered clean water. <br><br>
            <b>Turbidity Test:</b> Water clarity will first be evaluated through visual inspection to identify any remaining sediments or organic materials. 
            Following this initial assessment, a spectrometer will be used to measure light refraction, comparing the filtered water to a tap water sample for a more precise analysis of turbidity levels. <br><br>
            <b>Flow Rate Test:</b> The filter system will be run using a sample of dirty water. The rate of water flow through the filter will be measured, with an ideal target of approximately two liters per hour. <br><br>
            <b>User Feedback:</b> Observations on ease of use and overall user experience will be recorded during testing. Additionally, classmates will be invited to provide feedback, particularly those with prior experience using filtration systems in hiking and backpacking settings. <br><br>
            <b>E. coli Test:</b> Samples of both unfiltered and filtered water will be collected and sent to the Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Laboratory for E. coli testing. If the filtered water does not meet EPA safe consumption standards, the design will be considered unsuccessful. <br><br>

            <p class="project-detail-desc">Initial testing yielded promising results, proving the effectiveness of our design in reducing turbidity 
                and E. coli presence. On average, turbidity levels decreased by 81.9% between unfiltered and purified water samples. The final 
                absorbance of the filtered water was only 0.0043 above tap water, indicating a high level of clarity. However, without a direct 
                conversion between absorbance and turbidity, confirming compliance with EPA standards remains uncertain. </p>

            <h2 class="project-detail-h2">Recommendations and Future Work</h2>
            <p class="project-detail-desc">
                Our Clean My Water project yielded promising results in natural water purification using pine xylem, pumice, and charcoal. 
                Further development is both viable and encouraged. Some limitations, particularly flow rate and long-term material sustainability,
                 warrant additional exploration to enhance the design’s effectiveness and real-world applicability. The following recommendations 
                 outline targeted strategies for further refinement.<br><br> 
                <b>Improve Flow Rate:</b> One of the most significant shortcomings of the final prototype was its slow filtration speed, approximately
                 one liter every 20 hours. Future iterations should focus on optimizing pine puck thickness, increasing surface area, and researching 
                 other means by which to increase the flow rate. Looking into mechanical aids, such as hand pumps or increased hydrostatic head to provide
                  more pressure could help solve this problem. <br><br>
                <b>Improve Longevity of Pine Filters:</b> The pine component is the most important component in the filtration process and currently lasts around one week. 
                Researching ways to preserve or dry pine disks without damaging the pores in the xylem cell walls would improve shelf-life without 
                reducing compromising on function. Additionally, testing alternative wood or plant types with greater availability could increase 
                practicality and reduce ecological strain.  <br><br>
                <b>Research Alternative Applications:</b> While the filter was initially designed for outdoor recreational use, its simplicity and
                 natural construction make it an feasible option for regions lacking access to municipal water treatment systems. Future work should 
                 include research and studies regarding rural or developing communities to assess how effective this project would be in those environments. 
                 Currently, MIT is conducting field work to test applications for this technology.   <br><br>
                <b>Conduct Long-Term Field Testing:</b> Field trials under real environmental conditions are essential to evaluate our system’s performance 
                over time and to identify problematic design components. Variables such as source water quality, temperature changes, and user handling 
                practices can all dramatically affect performance and should be studied to improve our current design. 
                These tests will provide more accurate insights into maintenance and issues. Additionally, more tests should be conducted in the 
                lab to verify our initial E coli. test results.  <br><br>
