        <h1>Potential Energy Propulsion Racer</h1>
        <p class="project-detail-desc">The purpose of this project is to create a 3D-printed vehicle that can perform as 
            well as possible on an obstacle course by using three available energy sources: the height of a four-foot ramp, 
            the stored energy in three mechanical springs, and the electrical energy in a 5V supercapacitor that drives a small 
            propeller. The entire vehicle must be designed in SolidWorks and printed in ABS on the Bambu Lab H2D Pro printers or 
            using PLA via other Bambu printers. At the moment it’s released, the vehicle must be small enough to fit inside a
             12” × 8” × 4” box, though it may automatically unfold or expand during its run. The final design also needs to include
              at least two gears that mesh and operate together on their own during motion.</p>

        <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Technologies used:</b> Mechanical design, spring mechanics, gravity physics, precision engineering.</p>

        <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>About the project:</b> The main challenge is to develop a lightweight and dependable system that can take these 
            different forms of stored energy and turn them into smooth, controlled movement across the course. Doing this well
             requires careful decisions about how to balance weight and strength, how to transmit spring energy effectively, 
             when to activate the propeller powered by the supercapacitor, and how to keep the vehicle stable as it accelerates 
             down the ramp and moves through obstacles.</p>

        <h2>Our Final Design</h2>

        <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Chassis</b> Our final car has a few special features in order to maximise point-gain. The design itself centers around the main chassis 
            and tracks. On the chassis, we secure the springs to points near the front and secure the springs with a separate piece that 
            is able to be press-fit into the car. The springs are then connected to a slider that is attached to the chassis and slides on tracks.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Gearbox</b> The gearbox uses a 12:1 compound gear ratio to amplify the torque from the spring system, 
            allowing for more controlled acceleration and better handling of obstacles.</p>

            <figcaption class="project-caption">Joints used to assemble car</figcaption>
        <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Integration</b> The car is designed to be printed in multiple pieces that can be assembled using snap-fit joints. 
            This modular approach allows for easier printing and assembly, as well as the ability to replace or modify individual components as needed. 
            The main drive axles are supported by ball bearings that are press-fit into the body that connects to the car. This allows for the car to drive 
            smoothly and straight without the need to 3d print our own axles. Our wheels were also made with a diameter of 3.75 inches to give room for the 
            lifting arms while maximizing the amount of distance traveled per rotation.</p>

            <figcaption class="project-caption">Lifting arms in motion</figcaption>
        <p class="project-detail-desc"><b>Lifting Arms</b> The lifting arms were an important part of our car. As a team, we decided to gain extra points by 
            hitting the optional spinners along the track. The lever arm is fixed to the front of the car, and the other arm is connected to the slider. 
            This allows the arm to lie flat when at the full extension of the springs and then rise as the car lifts up, hitting the spinners. 
            We needed the arm to raise as the spinners were 6 inches above the track, and our car needed to fit under 4 inches in height.

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p class="project-detail-desc">We chose to utilize the ramp at the beginning of the track to overcome static friction and simply get the car moving. 
            Immediately after the ramp, we decided to place a long jump. This was to be our main source of points. 
            The idea is that once the jump is completed, we will already have net +200 points (500 - 300 from the ramp). 
            From there, we can attempt to hit the spinner targets for 200 points each and cross carpet sections for 100 points each.</p>

            <figcaption class="project-caption">Testing the car on the course</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="project-detail-desc"> This was one of our practice runs, we were able to effectively cross the long jump and hit one of the spinners. 
            However our car would drift to the left due to one of the wheels slipping due to the torque from the gearbox. This video was posted on our 
            Dean of Engineerings instagram reaching 1.8 million views!</p>
        <p class="project-detail-desc"> After this run, we changed the course adding in another small jump for an extra 200 points which we accomplished. 
            After all the testing was over, certain teams were awarded extra points for different challenges. We earned an extra 500 points as our car earned the 
            Elegance award for best design, giving us 1200 points total, placing us third overall.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="project-detail-desc"> Overall, this project was a great experience in mechanical design and problem-solving. 
            It challenged us to think critically about how to effectively use different energy sources to achieve our goals. 
            The final design successfully integrated spring mechanics, gravity, and electrical propulsion to navigate the obstacle course and earn points. 
            This project not only enhanced our technical skills but also fostered teamwork and creativity in engineering design.</p>

        <p class="project-detail-desc">Had we more time to go back and change our design further, we would have changed a few things. 
            First, we would have redesigned the lifting arms to be a bit more rigid as they tended to wobble when hitting the spinners. 
            Additionally, we would have worked on improving the alignment of the wheels to prevent drifting and ensure a straighter path down the course. 
            We also might have experimented with different spring tensions to optimize the balance between speed and control throughout the run.
            Finally, we would of added the optional 5v super capacitor and propeller to the front of our car to give us a boost when our springs ran out. </p>
